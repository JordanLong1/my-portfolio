            Welcome to my portfolio site, My name is Jordan Long and I'm a coding bootcamp graudate (Flatiron School). I am from a small town called Orland, California right next to a better known place named Chico. After spending roughly 25 years in that area I recently moved to the Bay Area.
            With a background in the Agriculture Industry and physical fitness I am transitioning to tech with adaptability, intuition, and an endless amount of curiosity.
            I possess a strong passion for integrative problem solving, creative design, and reading and writing code that is aimed to fulfill a users experience.
